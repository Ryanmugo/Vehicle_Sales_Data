## Recommendations

## 1. Sales Improvement Opportunities
  - **Focus on High-Margin Models**

     - **Toyota and Dodge:**
         - **Toyota:** $568,133
         - **Dodge:** $507,261

     - **Profit Margins:**

         - **Dodge:** $101,452.20
           
     - **Strategy:** Increase marketing efforts for Toyota and Dodge during the months of August and September, where sales are highest. For instance, a 10% increase in marketing budget could lead to a potential sales increase of 5-7% during these periods, translating to an additional $25,000 to $35,000 in sales.




## 2. Cost Reduction Strategies

  - **Optimize Productions Costs**

     - **Average Production Costs:** $44,161.62
     - **Potential Savings:** By renegotiating supplier contracts or implementing lean manufacturing techniques, we could aim to reduce production costs by 5-10%. This could result in savings of approximately $2,200 to $4,400 per vehicle, improving overall profit margins by 5-8%.

## 3. Customer Retention and Expansion

**Objective:** Increase customer retention and repeat purchases by implementing a loyalty program.

**Strategy and Potential Impact:**

  - **Customer Retention Increase:** By introducing a loyalty program, we anticipate an increase in repeat customers by 10%.
  - **Sales Growth:** This increase in repeat customers is expected to lead to a 3% rise in total sales.
  -  **Financial Impact:** Considering the average sale per customer is $30,000, this strategy could result in approximately $90,000 in additional sales annually.

**Example Calculation:**
  - If our current total sales amount to $3 million annually, a 3% increase would add $90,000 to our annual revenue.
  - This strategy not only boosts sales but also enhances customer satisfaction and brand loyalty, which is crucial for long-term business sustainability and growth.
