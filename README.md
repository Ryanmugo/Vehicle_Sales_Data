# Vehicle Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This analysis was conducted to provide insights into vehicle sales, identify opportunities for cost reduction, and propose strategies for improving profits and sales in the upcoming year (2013). The analysis was performed using two primary tools: Excel and Tableau.


## Key Objectives:

  - **Reduce Production Costs:** Assess potential savings through cost reduction strategies.
  - **Improve Profit Margins:** Identify high-margin products and areas where profitability can be enhanced.
  - **Boost Sales**: Analyze sales trends to recommend strategies for increasing sales in 2013.

### 1. Excel Analysis

#### 1.1 Data Preparation

   - **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicate records, handled missing data, and standardized formats.

#### 1.2 Analysis Approach

   - **Pivot Tables:** Used to summarize total sales by manufacturer, analyze peak sales during specific launches, and identify best-performing cars in terms of fuel efficiency, profit margins, and pricing.

#### 1.3 Key Findings from Excel

   - Toyota led in both total sales and profit margins.
   - Dodge and Toyota were top performers in fuel efficiency.
   - Identified areas for improvement, particularly for Chevrolet.

#### 1.4 Limitations of Excel Analysis

  - No time-based filtering, providing only a broad overview of the entire dataset.

### 2. Tableau Analysis

#### 2.1 Interactive Dashboard

   - To further explore the data, an interactive dashboard was created in Tableau, which can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.gathari/viz/VehicleSalesDashboard_17240578272380/VehicleDashboard?publish=yes).


#### 2.2. Key Features of the Tableau Dashboard

  - **Year and Quarter Filters:** Allows users to filter and analyze data by specific years and quarters, enabling a more granular analysis of sales trends over time.
  - **Sales Trend Analysis:** Visual representation of sales performance across different quarters in 2011 and 2012.  
  - **Impact of Cost Reduction:** Visualized the effect of a 5% reduction in production costs on overall savings and profitability.
  - **Comparison of Performance Shifts:** Analysis of performance changes between specific quarters (e.g., Q2 2011 vs. Q2 2012). 

#### 2.3 Key Findings from Tableau

  - Significant sales decline in Q1 2012 compared to Q1 2011, highlighting potential market challenges.
  - Strong Q4 2011 performance, suggesting effective year-end promotions.
  - Partial recovery in Q2 2012, pointing to corrective measures.
  - Visualization of potential cost savings through strategic cost reduction.

#### 2.4 Advantages of Tableau Analysis

  - **Time-Based Filtering:** Provided deeper insights by allowing analysis of specific time periods.
  - **Interactive Visualizations:** Enabled real-time data exploration and pattern identification.


### 3. Recommendations

Based on the analysis conducted using Excel and Tableau, the following recommendations are proposed:

  - **Implement Cost Reduction Strategies:** Focus on reducing production costs by at least 5% to improve profitability, especially during low sales periods.
  - **Enhance Q4 Promotions:** Replicate successful strategies from Q4 2011 to boost year-end sales in 2013.
  - **Monitor Market Trends:** Keep a close watch on market conditions and consumer preferences to avoid drastic declines like those observed in Q1 2012.
  - **Invest in High-Margin Products:** Prioritize the production and marketing of high-margin products, such as those from Toyota and Dodge, to maximize profits.
  - **Address Below-Average Margins:** Investigate and address the factors leading to low profit margins for manufacturers like Chevrolet.


### 4. Conclusion

The combination of Excel and Tableau provided a comprehensive analysis of vehicle sales data, from broad overviews to detailed time-based insights. While Excel offered a solid foundation for understanding overall trends, Tableau enabled deeper exploration, particularly with its powerful filtering and visualization capabilities. Together, these tools allowed for a thorough analysis that informed strategic recommendations for improving sales and profitability in 2013.
